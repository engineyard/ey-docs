# Environments on Engine Yard Cloud

**Environment** is an overloaded term. Here at Engine Yard when we refer to your 
'environment' we are talking about the cluster of instances that collectively run 
an application or set of applications. 

An environment includes Application Instance(s), Database Instance(s), and possibly
one or more Utility Instances. Check out this article if you want to know more about 
the various instances types: [[Compute instances on Engine Yard Cloud|instance-types]].
