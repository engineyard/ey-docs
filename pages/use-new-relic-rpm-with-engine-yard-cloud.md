# Monitor your Engine Yard applications with New Relic

## Introduction

[New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) is a tool for monitoring real-time web application performance â€” from the end-user experience down to a line of application code. 

You get real data about your users. For example, you can see what countries your users are in, what browsers they use, how long they wait for pages to download. You get trending data; is your application is faster or slower this week than last week? When problems occur, you can get a transaction response performance breakdown and view a detailed timeline of an individual request.    

**Note:** New Relic Standard is free for AppCloud customers.

### Process for setting up and using New Relic to monitor your application

1. [Choose a New Relic plan] [1]

<h2 id="topic1"> Choose a New Relic plan</h2>

### Introduction

The first task in setting up New Relic is to choose the plan you want. The Standard plan is free with your Engine Yard account. But, you might decide that the Professional plan better suits you needs. 

### To choose a New Relic plan

1. In AppCloud, click Account > Account Settings.
    
2. Click your account name.

3. Under the Services section at the bottom of the Account page, click Manage your New Relic plan.

3. Read and agree to the New Relic Terms of Service and select the check box. 
	
4. Choose the Standard plan or the Professional plan.
    
5. Activate a plan.

Your New Relic account is created automatically using your Engine Yard account and password. 

If you selected the Professional plan, the New Relic charge appears on your AppCloud account bill; you won't get a separate bill from New Relic.
