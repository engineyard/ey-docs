Instances on Engine Yard Cloud comprise of the compute resources that are dedicated to running
your Ruby application in the cloud.  Instances can be configured to serve your 
application tier, database tier, cache tier, background processing and utilities, 
and more.  Instances are available in various configurations to 
meet your CPU, memory, and disk space needs.

## Persistent storage
Your application code and database are written out to **persistent storage** 
volumes. We automatically mount these volumes and take backups for you.

Both the `/data` mount on the application master instance and the `/db` mount on the database 
master instance(s) are persistent. We take advantage of Amazon's EBS storage allowing us to 
take regular disk snapshots of both of these volumes. 

If you ever have to rebuild your instances from scratch you will have the ability to restore 
both of these volumes from previous snapshots.
