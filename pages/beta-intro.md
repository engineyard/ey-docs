##About Alpha features

Alpha features have been implemented with the minimum required functionality; might still be in development; might use Open Source technology that is not "production-ready". 

For Open Source stack Alpha features, the underlying technology might be solid but the feature is Alpha because it is new to the Engine Yard Technology Stack.

Alpha features are available on request for users who want to test and help improve the features.

##About Beta features

When a feature is nearly ready for Production applications; has been used and verified by some Engine Yard Cloud users; has documentation; and a trained Support team, then we promote it from Alpha to Beta.
