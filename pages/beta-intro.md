# Engine Yard Beta Program


<p >
  <img id="beta-logo" src="images/ey-beta-logo.png" >
  Deploying, automating and managing a Rails application is constantly
  changing. New stack elements, new features in AppCloud and xCloud, 
  and new tools to help development are released often. We think many of 
  these features will be interesting to our customers whilst they are still 
  in development.  If you are interested in testing out beta features on
  AppCloud, read on for more information!
</p>

**There are four parts to our Beta Program:**

  * Beta Announcements
  * Beta Conversations
  * Alpha features and improvements
  * Beta features and improvements

Access to the Beta program **does not** require an Engine Yard Support 
agreement. Each new beta feature has its own support channel 
(see below).  We appreciate any feedback received during the beta program.
Feedback received helps us refine our beta technology to provide a better 
experience for our customers.

In advance, we want to thank you for your participation and we appreciate your feedback!

## Beta Announcements

We will only notify people about new features via one mailing list. If you want to be notified please join the [[Beta Announcements|http://groups.google.com/group/ey-beta-announce]] Google group below.

## Alpha Features

"Alpha" features have been implemented with the minimum required functionality, they may still be in development, they may use Open Source technology that itself is not qualified as "production-ready"; but hey, some customers want it sooner than later and are happy to help us iron out any missing aspects. 

For this reason we created a way for a small handful of our customers to help us, and for us to help you, on each new feature. We call them Alpha Features.

For Open Source stack items, the underlying technology might be rock solid but it might be classed as an "Alpha Feature" because it is relatively new to the Engine Yard Technology Stack. Once a few customers have trialled it and given it the green light, and we've finished our documentation and Support training, we'll move it to Beta and beyond.

Alpha features are currently available to test on an as requested basis for customers who are willing to help us move these important features forward from Alpha to Beta.

Alpha features carry a **warning: do not request support via the normal support channels**.

Current Alpha Features (and how to request access):

* [[PostgreSQL 9|postgresql]] - [[Request access|signup-postgresql]]
* [[Rubinius]] - [[Request access|signup-rubinius]]

## Beta Features

When we feel a feature is close to being ready for Production applications, has been used and verified by a handful of Engine Yard customers, has a set of documentation and our Support team is being trained on the feature/technology, we can promote the feature from "Alpha" to "Beta".

Beta features are visible and usable by all Engine Yard customers (as applicable AppCloud and xCloud) but carry a **warning: do not request support via the normal support channels**. 

For each Beta feature there is the [[Beta Conversations|http://groups.google.com/group/ey-beta-talk]] group to discuss bugs, issues, and feature requests with Engine Yard staff and other Engine Yard customers.

Current Beta feature:

  * [[Passenger 3|using-passenger-with-engine-yard-appcloud]]
  * [[JRuby/Trinidad|jruby-beta]]
