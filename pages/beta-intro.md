# Engine Yard Early Access and Labs

**Important!** Always test Early Access (Alpha or Beta) and Engine Yard Labs features very carefully in a development or staging environment.

No features are in Beta. 

These features are in **Alpha**:  

* [[High availability|environment-high-availability]] - [[Sign up|signup-high-availability]]
* [[Ruby 1.9.3|ruby-193]] - [[Sign up|signup-ruby193]]

* [[PostgreSQL 9|postgresql]] - [[Sign up|signup-postgresql]]
* [[Rubinius|rubinius]] - [[Sign up|signup-rubinius]]

Sign up to get access to Alpha features. The high availability, MySQL, and PostgreSQL features require full accounts. If you have a trial account and want to upgrade to a full account, see [[Upgrading free trial account|upgrading-free-trial-to-full-account]].

This feature is in **Labs**:

##About Beta features

When a feature is nearly ready for Production applications; has been used and verified by some Engine Yard Cloud users; has documentation; and a trained Support team, then we promote it from Alpha to Beta.

##About Alpha features

Alpha features have been implemented with the minimum required functionality; might still be in development; might use Open Source technology that is not "production-ready". 

For Open Source stack Alpha features, the underlying technology might be solid but the feature is Alpha because it is new to the Engine Yard Technology Stack.

Alpha features are available on request for users who want to test and help improve the features.

##About Labs features

Labs features are experimental features that Engine Yard makes available to developers. Some Labs features might later be incorporated into our product; some might remain as Labs features; and some tried and then deprecated.
