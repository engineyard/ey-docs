# Clone an environment


Engine Yard Cloud provides a clone feature that takes an environment and creates a new standalone copy.
When an environment is cloned, *nearly* everything including the volumes that your 
original environment uses are copied, *excluding* cron jobs and custom files such as custom chef recipes.

An excellent use case for cloning an environment is creating an on-demand 
staging environment from your production application. This relieves the chore 
and cost of maintaining a full-time staging environment and provides the flexibility
of spinning up an environment on-demand within a matter of minutes.



## Create a clone

1. Login to your Engine Yard account.
2. Click the Dashboard menu item.
3. Navigate to the environment you want to clone by clicking on the environment name.
5. Click Clone Environment.<br />
   You should be redirected to the "Create a clone" page.
6. Enter the information necessary for your cloned environment. (See [[Clone options|environment-clone#options]] below.)
7. Click Clone Environment. <br />
   You should be redirected to your new environment clone that is being provisioned.
7. If needed, add cron jobs or custom chef recipes to the cloned environment.  
    **Important!** Cron jobs and custom chef recipes are _not_ cloned.

**Tip:** If you create a clone for staging/testing, remember to shut down the clone after testing is complete.
