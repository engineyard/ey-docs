# Engine Yard AppCloud

## Our Most Popular Cloud Platform
You can use Engine Yard [[AppCloud|http://www.engineyard.com/products/appcloud]] to easily deploy your Rails application on Amazon's EC2 cloud.  From smaller-scale web applications that run within a single compute instance, to production applications that require the elasticity, scalability and reliability of multiple instances running at "full-tilt", Engine Yard's AppCloud can scale with your needs.

With Engine Yard AppCloud you only pay for what you use `- there are no setup or environment fees, and you don't need your own Amazon account. Automated load balancing and full spectrum monitoring mean that you get the reliability you need, along with essential infrastructure services such as persistent storage, web-based gem installs, data backup/restore, and system monitoring — all backed by legendary [[Engine Yard Rails support|http://www.engineyard.com/support]] and the battle-tested [[Engine Yard Ruby on Rails stack|http://www.engineyard.com/technology/stack]].
