# Monitoring your application on AppCloud


Monitoring is considered a best practice when deploying your application
into production.  AppCloud can monitor your environment and alert you via
email when abnormal resource usage occurs. Some of the resources AppCloud 
can monitor on a per environment basis include: CPU usage, IO-Wait, Swap 
Used and Free Space. 

**Important:** If you are a paid support customer, having alerts and monitoring enabled
for your environments allows our support team to proactively monitor your
environments for abnormal activity. Be sure to enable monitoring for your 
environments as monitoring is disabled by default.

**Important:** Monitoring and email alerts are disabled by default.
