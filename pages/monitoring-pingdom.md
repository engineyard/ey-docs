# Monitoring with Pingdom

Pingdom is a great external tool for monitoring your application uptime. Pingdom can send you phone and email alerts if your site goes down. Pingdom also provides uptime and response time reports.

This page describes how to setup Pingdom to monitor your AppCloud application. 
<!--This page also describes how to use FitterHappier to create a unique URI for your application specifically to be monitored by Pingdom.-->

## What pages should I monitor with Pingdom?
In general, do not monitor your home page. This is because your home page may have external dependencies that make page loading slow and thus not accurately reflect your site response time. Moreover, if one of these dependencies goes down, it brings down your home page even when the rest of your application is still functioning correctly. Also, pinging your homepage creates more load on an already heavily trafficked page.

Better practice is to ping a less commonly visited page.

<!-- <h2 id="topic2"> (Optional) Install the FitterHappier plugin</h2>

FitterHappier is a Rails plugin that provides actions for monitoring the availability of websites and databases. The FitterHappier monitoring controller disables unnecessary Rails features, such as sessions, layouts, and logging. It creates URIs that can be monitored fast and efficiently.

For information about the FitterHappier plugin, see [[github.com/atmos/fitter_happier|http://github.com/atmos/fitter_happier]]. 

<h3 id="topic5">To install the FitterHappier plugin</h3>

1. Run the following commands from the project root of your Rails application:

        cd vendor/plugins
        git clone git://github.com/atmos/fitter_happier.git

2. Start your application in development mode and test the following URIs:

        curl localhost:3000/fitter_happier
        FitterHappier Site Check Passed

        curl localhost:3000/fitter_happier/site_check
        FitterHappier Site Check Passed @ Wed, 17 Dec 2008 14:27:47 -0800

        curl localhost:3000/fitter_happier/site_and_database_check
        FitterHappier Site and Database Check Passed @ Wed, 17 Dec 2008 14:27:57 -0800
        Schema Version: 20081217141904


<h2 id="topic3"> (Optional) Update and verify your environment for the FitterHappier plugin</h2>

After you install FitterHappier, redeploy your application and confirm that the FitterHappier URIs have been added to your deployed application. 

### To update and verify your environment
1. Commit the changes to your git repository so that the FitterHappier plugin is added to your application.   
2. Redeploy your application.
3. Verify that the deployment was successful by testing the same URIs as [above][5], replacing "localhost:3000" with your application's hostname. -->

<h2 id="topic4"> Add a check to Pingdom</h2>

Tell Pingdom what URI to check, how often, and where to send an alert if the URI goes down.

###To add a check 
1. Log into your Pingdom account.
2. Click Add new check.
3. Complete the fields on the Add new check page:  
    * Resolution - Pinging the URI every 5 minutes is a good default.
    * Check type - HTTP
    * URL/IP - For example, `www.mysite.com/about.html`
4. Test and add the check.

<!--    * URL/IP â€” For example, <!-- `www.mysite.com/fitter_happier/site_check` or `www.mysite.com/about.html` -->
