Finally, select the external address of your application and click "Boot this Configuration"


## Edit an Application

There is more than one way to get to the edit an application screen.

  * The Applications tab under SERVER TOOLS will list your applications.
  * You can then click the name of your application to edit.

  * In your environment, under the Applications tab there is an Edit link.

After you're on the Edit Application screen you'll be able to modify the following options.

  * Git Repository URI
  * Application Type
  * Domain Name

Save the settings by clicking Update application button.

You can add additional software packages to your application within Engine Yard Cloud. Packages are added at the account-level.
