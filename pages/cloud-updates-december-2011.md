<a href=#update2><h2 id="update2"><b>Major:</b> Database slave instances can be sized differently from the database master instances</h2></a>

December 2nd, 2011

There are two ways that database slaves can be sized differently:  

* Instance sizing
* /db volume sizing
 

**Instance sizing**

Now, when you create a custom cluster or add a database slave to an existing cluster, the database slave can be a larger or a smaller instance than the master database instance.

*Scenario 1: A smaller database slave instance.* Your database slave is only for replication. Save money by using a database slave instance that is less powerful than the master database instance. 

*Scenario 2: A larger database slave instance.* Your database master instance gets an average amount of traffic, but your reporting software puts a lot of load on your database slave instance. Make your reporting more robust with a more powerful database slave instance.

**/db volume sizing**

Now, when you add a database slave to an existing cluster, the slave can have a /db volume larger than the master database /db volume. 

*Scenario:* The /db volume on your master database is getting full. Add a database slave with a larger volume and after replication is finished, work with Engine Yard Support to promote the slave to master and decommission the original (smaller) master. 

To take advantage of /db volume resizing, upgrade your environment. For more information, see [[Add a database slave to an existing environment|database-environments#topic3]].
