# Linking a GitHub account to an Engine Yard account

You can link your Engine Yard account to a GitHub account. 

The _advantage_ of linking your Engine Yard account to a GitHub account is that you don't need to cut-and-paste deploy keys if the accounts are linked. 

The _disadvantage_ of linking your Engine Yard account to a GitHub account is that it gives your Engine Yard Cloud collaborators read access to **all** repositories in that GitHub account. 

This page contains the following procedures:

  * [Link your Engine Yard account to a GitHub account] [2]  
  * [Create an application from a repository in a linked GitHub account] [3]  
  * [Unlink your Engine Yard account from a GitHub account] [4] 

<h2 id="topic1">Which GitHub account to link to?</h2>

You can link your Engine Yard account to only one GitHub account. Make sure that you choose the GitHub account that contains:

*  The repositories for the applications that you want to host on Engine Yard Cloud. 

*  Only repositories that you want your collaborators to see.

For example, you might have two GitHub accounts: a personal GitHub account for early phase and private projects and a group account that contains the mainline versions of your company's applications and that your colleagues/collaborators already have access to. You choose the group account to link your Engine Yard account to.
