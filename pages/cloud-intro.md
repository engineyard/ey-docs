# Engine Yard Cloud

## Our Most Popular Cloud Platform
Easily deploy your Rails and Ruby applications to Amazon's EC2 cloud using the 
Engine Yard [[Cloud|http://www.engineyard.com/products/cloud]] Platform. From 
smaller-scale web applications that run within a single compute instance, to production applications that require the elasticity, scalability and reliability of multiple instances 
running at "full-tilt", Engine Yard Cloud can scale with your needs.

## Benefits of using Engine Yard Cloud

With Engine Yard Cloud you only pay for what you use. There are no setup or 
environment fees, and you don't need your own separate Amazon AWS account. Automated load balancing 
and full spectrum monitoring mean that you get the reliability you need, along with 
essential infrastructure services such as persistent storage, web-based gem installs, 
data backup/restore, and system monitoring \- all backed by legendary 
[[Engine Yard Rails support|http://www.engineyard.com/support]] and the battle-tested 
[[Engine Yard Ruby on Rails stack|http://www.engineyard.com/technology/stack]].


## Engine Yard Cloud is an ideal solution for:

### Application Developers
Start from scratch and get your first application up and running in less than five 
minutes. Need to test out new code? Clone your production environment and test your 
new code on the clone, then terminate the clone after your test is complete. Using 
application cloning, a 20-server environment can cost less than $4 for an hour-long 
integration test.

### Application Architects
There are no compromises with Engine Yard Cloud. Design applications with the 
modules, plugins and packages that you know and trust. Passenger, memcached, Tokyo, 
Redis, Sphinx and more \- they're all right there, ready for use. With our extensible 
recipe system you can add and automate anything else that you need. And you can always 
rely on Engine Yard professional consulting services for advice on architecture scaling, 
with everything from caching to sharding to data architectures.

### Application Owners
Worried about application uptime costs or data security? With Engine Yard Cloud, you 
only pay for what you use and your support costs scale based on the size of your site. Furthermore, 
you always get the latest security patches, and it only takes a single click to upgrade 
your environments with a new patch.

### Web Development Firms
Tired of all those non-billable hours for customer handoff that seem to creep into every 
project? With cloud-based application development and deployment, you can ensure an easy 
and predictable application handoff. Build your architecture as you go, and always have a 
customer-handoff ready application stored on Engine Yard Cloud, ready to be spun up 
into a live environment. Best of all, when your environment isn't running, you only pay 
minimal data costs to store your data.
